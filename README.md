This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where modifying the innerHTML of an element that has its display style set to 'none' using JavaScript will not make the element visible again.  The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.html provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from how the browser renders elements that have their display property set to none. Modifying innerHTML does not automatically trigger a recalculation of the element's visibility.
